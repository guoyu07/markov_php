A note about this book, February 12, 2004:
==========================================

As you will see, when you read the text beneath this section, I released this book a little over a year ago under the terms of a Creative Commons license that allowed my readers to freely redistribute the text without needing any further permission from me. In this fashion, I enlisted my readers in the service of a grand experiment, to see how my book could find its way into cultural relevance and commercial success. The experiment worked out very satisfactorily.

When I originally licensed the book under the terms set out in the next section, I did so in the most conservative fashion possible, using CC's most restrictive license. I wanted to dip my toe in before taking a plunge. I wanted to see if the sky would fall: you see writers are routinely schooled by their peers that maximal copyright is the only thing that stands between us and penury, and so ingrained was this lesson in me that even though I had the intellectual intuition that a "some rights reserved" regime would serve me well, I still couldn't shake the atavistic fear that I was about to do something very foolish indeed.

It wasn't foolish. I've since released a short story collection:

	A Place So Foreign and Eight More
	http://craphound.com/place
	
and a second novel:

	Eastern Standard Tribe
	http://craphound.com/est
	
in this fashion, and my career is turning over like a goddamned locomotive engine. I am thrilled beyond words (an extraordinary circumstance for a writer!) at the way that this has all worked out.

And so *now* I'm going to take a little bit of a plunge. Today, in coincidence with my talk at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference:

	Ebooks: Neither E, Nor Books
	http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/view/e_sess/4693
	
I am re-licensing this book under a far less restrictive Creative Commons license, the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. This is a license that allows you, the reader, to noncommercially "remix" this book -- you have my blessing to make your own translations, radio and film adaptations, sequels, fan fiction, missing chapters, machine remixes, you name it. A number of you assumed that you had my blessing to do this in the first place, and I can't say that I've been at all put out by the delightful and creative derivative works created from this book, but now you have my explicit blessing, and I hope you'll use it.

Here's the license in summary:

	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/
	
	You are free:
	
		* to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work 
		
		* to make derivative works

		Noncommercial. You may not use this work for commercial purposes.

		you may distribute the resulting work only under a license
		identical to this one.
	
	* For any reuse or distribution, you must make clear to others
	  the license terms of this work. 
	
	* Any of these conditions can be waived if you get permission 
	  from the author.
	
	Your fair use and other rights are in no way affected by the
	above.
	
And here is the license in full:

	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 1.0
	
	CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT
	PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DRAFT LICENSE DOES
	NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS

	THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
	CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK

	BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT
	AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR
	GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
	ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
	
	1. Definitions

	   1. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a
	   periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
	   which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form,
	   along with a number of other contributions,
	   constituting separate and independent works in
	   themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A
	   work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
	   considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
	   the purposes of this License.
	
	   2. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the
	   Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
	   such as a translation, musical arrangement,
	   dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
	   version, sound recording, art reproduction,
	   abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which
	   the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
	   except that a work that constitutes a Collective
	   Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
	   the purpose of this License.
	
	   3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that
	   offers the Work under the terms of this License.
	
	   4. "Original Author" means the individual or entity
	   who created the Work.
	
	   5. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship
	   offered under the terms of this License.
	
	   6. "You" means an individual or entity exercising
	   rights under this License who has not previously
	   violated the terms of this License with respect to
	   the Work, or who has received express permission
	   from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
	   License despite a previous violation.

	2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to
	reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use,
	first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the
	copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
	
	3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
	License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
	non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
	copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
	below:

		   1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work
		   into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce
		   the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
		
		   2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
		
		   3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
		   publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by
		   means of a digital audio transmission the Work
		   including as incorporated in Collective Works;
		
		   4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
		   publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by
		   means of a digital audio transmission Derivative
		   Works;

	The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats
	whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include
	the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary
	to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not
	expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
	
	4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
	expressly made subject to and limited by the following
	restrictions:

		   1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly
		   perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only
		   under the terms of this License, and You must
		   include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
		   Identifier for, this License with every copy or
		   phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly
		   display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
		   perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
		   the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this
		   License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
		   granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.
		   You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
		   License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
		   not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
		   or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
		   technological measures that control access or use of
		   the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of
		   this License Agreement. The above applies to the
		   Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
		   does not require the Collective Work apart from the
		   Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
		   License. If You create a Collective Work, upon
		   notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
		   practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
		   reference to such Licensor or the Original Author,
		   as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
		   notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
		   practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any
		   reference to such Licensor or the Original Author,
		   as requested.
		
		   2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly
		   perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
		   Work only under the terms of this License, and You
		   must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
		   Identifier for, this License with every copy or
		   phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
		   publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
		   digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any
		   terms on the Derivative Works that alter or restrict
		   the terms of this License or the recipients'
		   exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You
		   must keep intact all notices that refer to this
		   License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
		   not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
		   or publicly digitally perform the Derivative Work
		   with any technological measures that control access
		   or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the
		   terms of this License Agreement. The above applies
		   to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a
		   Collective Work, but this does not require the
		   Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work
		   itself to be made subject to the terms of this
		   License.
		
		   3. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to
		   You in Section 3 above in any manner that is
		   primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
		   advantage or private monetary compensation. The
		   exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by
		   means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not
		   be considered to be intended for or directed toward
		   commercial advantage or private monetary
		   compensation, provided there is no payment of any
		   monetary compensation in connection with the
		   exchange of copyrighted works.
		
		   4. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly
		   perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or
		   any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must
		   keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
		   give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
		   medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the
		   name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original
		   Author if supplied; the title of the Work if
		   supplied; in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
		   identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative
		   Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
		   Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
		   Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be
		   implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
		   however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
		   Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
		   appear where any other comparable authorship credit
		   appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
		   such other comparable authorship credit.

	5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

	   1. By offering the Work for public release under
	   this License, Licensor represents and warrants that,
	   to the best of Licensor's knowledge after reasonable
	   inquiry:

         1. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work
         necessary to grant the license rights
         hereunder and to permit the lawful exercise of
         the rights granted hereunder without You
         having any obligation to pay any royalties,
         compulsory license fees, residuals or any
         other payments;

         2. The Work does not infringe the copyright,
         trademark, publicity rights, common law rights
         or any other right of any third party or
         constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or
         other tortious injury to any third party.

	   2. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR
	   OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY
	   APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS"
	   BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER
	   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
	   ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF
	   THE WORK.

	6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
	APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO
	A THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION
	5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
	FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
	DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN
	IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
	
	7. Termination

	   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder
	   will terminate automatically upon any breach by You
	   of the terms of this License. Individuals or
	   entities who have received Derivative Works or
	   Collective Works from You under this License,
	   however, will not have their licenses terminated
	   provided such individuals or entities remain in full
	   compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
	   7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
	   License.
	
	   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
	   license granted here is perpetual (for the duration
	   of the applicable copyright in the Work).
	   Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
	   right to release the Work under different license
	   terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
	   provided, however that any such election will not
	   serve to withdraw this License (or any other license
	   that has been, or is required to be, granted under
	   the terms of this License), and this License will
	   continue in full force and effect unless terminated
	   as stated above.

	8. Miscellaneous

	   1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
	   perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor
	   offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the
	   same terms and conditions as the license granted to
	   You under this License.
	
	   2. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
	   perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the
	   recipient a license to the original Work on the same
	   terms and conditions as the license granted to You
	   under this License.
	
	   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or
	   unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
	   affect the validity or enforceability of the
	   remainder of the terms of this License, and without
	   further action by the parties to this agreement,
	   such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
	   extent necessary to make such provision valid and
	   enforceable.
	
	   4. No term or provision of this License shall be
	   deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such
	   waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
	   the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
	
	   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement
	   between the parties with respect to the Work
	   licensed here. There are no understandings,
	   agreements or representations with respect to the
	   Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound
	   by any additional provisions that may appear in any
	   communication from You. This License may not be
	   modified without the mutual written agreement of the
	   Licensor and You.


========================================
A note about this book, January 2, 2003:
========================================

"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" is my first novel. It's an actual, no-foolin' words-on-paper book, published by the good people at Tor Books in New York City. You can buy this book in stores or online, by following links like this one:

	http://www.craphound.com/down/buy.php

So, what's with this file? Good question. 

I'm releasing the entire text of this book as a free, freely redistributable e-book. You can download it, put it on a P2P net, put it on your site, email it to a friend, and, if you're addicted to dead trees, you can even print it. 

Why am I doing this thing? Well, it's a long story, but to shorten it up: first-time novelists have a tough row to hoe. Our publishers don't have a lot of promotional budget to throw at unknown factors like us. Mostly, we rise and fall based on word-of-mouth. I'm not bad at word-of-mouth. I have a blog, Boing Boing (http://boingboing.net), where I do a *lot* of word-of-mouthing. I compulsively tell friends and strangers about things that I like. 

And telling people about stuff I like is *way*, *way* easier if I can just send it to 'em. Way easier.

What's more, P2P nets kick all kinds of ass. Most of the books, music and movies ever released are not available for sale, anywhere in the world. In the brief time that P2P nets have flourished, the ad-hoc masses of the Internet have managed to put just about *everything* online. What's more, they've done it for cheaper than any other archiving/revival effort ever. I'm a stone infovore and this kinda Internet mishegas gives me a serious frisson of futurosity. 

Yeah, there are legal problems. Yeah, it's hard to figure out how people are gonna make money doing it. Yeah, there is a lot of social upheaval and a serious threat to innovation, freedom, business, and whatnot. It's your basic end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenario, and as a science fiction writer, end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenaria are my stock-in-trade.

I'm especially grateful to my publisher, Tor Books (http://www.tor.com) and my editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden (http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite) for being hep enough to let me try out this experiment.

All that said, here's the deal: I'm releasing this book under a license developed by the Creative Commons project (http://creativecommons.org/). This is a project that lets people like me roll our own license agreements for the distribution of our creative work under terms similar to those employed by the Free/Open Source Software movement. It's a great project, and I'm proud to be a part of it. 

Here's a summary of the license:

	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0
	
	Attribution. The licensor permits others to copy, distribute,
	display, and perform the work. In return, licensees must give the
	original author credit.
	
	No Derivative Works. The licensor permits others to copy,
	distribute, display and perform only unaltered copies of the work
	-- not derivative works based on it.
	
	Noncommercial. The licensor permits others to copy, distribute,
	display, and perform the work. In return, licensees may not use
	the work for commercial purposes -- unless they get the
	licensor's permission.
